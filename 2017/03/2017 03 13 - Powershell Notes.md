# PowerShell

Every cmdlet in PowerShell is verb-noun.  
Nouns are always singular.  

## The four big POSH verbs

### New
Creates something new. No cmdlet starts with create-. new-vm creates a VM.  

### Get
Show or List.  
get-vm would show all VMs on a hyper-v server.  

### Set 
Changes some characteristic.  
set-vm would rename a VM, change RAM size, etc.  

### Remove
Deletes.  
remove-vm would delete a VM.  

## Less-common POSH verbs  
add, clear, test, measure, rename  
Use `get-verb` to see all cmdlets
