# OneGet

OneGet is a package manager for Windows.  
It can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) as a package source.  
Other sources include: PowerShellGallery.com and NuGet.  

## Cmdlets 

[Full list of cmdlets](https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/wiki/cmdlets)

`Get-PackageProvider` to list existing package providers.  

Modules work with PowerShellGallery.com, while Package works with NuGet and Chocolatey. I'm not sure why there's a difference.    

`Find-Module moduleName` to search for a module.  
`Install-Module moduleName` to install a module.  
`Get-InstalledModule -name moduleName` to check if a module is already installed.  
`Uninstall-Module -name moduleName`  to uninstall.  

`find-package -name jquery -provider Nuget` to find a package.  
`install-package jquery` to install.  
`uninstall-package jquery` to uninstall.
