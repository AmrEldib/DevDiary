# Rename Downloaded Files using Context Menu

# Problem

There are lots of files that I download on regular basis and need to rename and move to their correct location. For example: Bank statements and bills.  
These files are predictable in their name, but I want to rename them to easily sort them and find them later.  
I also want to move them to the correct folder.  
I want to be able to simply right-click on the downloaded file, and execute one command that would:  
- Recognize which file it is.  
- Rename it.  
- Move it to where it should be filed.  
- (Optionally) Show up a notification of where it went.  

# Solution

I can use [AdvancedRenamer](https://www.advancedrenamer.com/) to create a preset for each category of files.
