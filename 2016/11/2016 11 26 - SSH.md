# Problem

Can't remember IP of remote machine when trying to SSH into it.

# Solution

SSH can provide nicknames for machines.  
To do this, add a `config` file into the `~/.ssh/` folder.  
This file will include the following:  
```
Host _nickname_  
     HostName _machine-ip_  
     User _username_  
     Port _port_
     IdentityFile _/path/to/key_  
```

# Problem

I keep getting prompted to provide key's passphrase every time I use SSH.  
Passphrases are harder to remember than passwords because they're typically longer.  

# Troubleshooting 

I'm using __Bash for Windows__. While this is supposed to be Linux, it's not exactly Linux. I'm expecting some differences.  
`ssh-agent` is in charge of remembering passphrases.  
To check if ssh-agent is running, use `eval 'ssh-agent -s'` or `eval "$(ssh-agent)"`.  

Using `ssh-add` should add the remote server, the key, and the passphrase.  
However, this worked well for one session. Once I closed the window, and opened it again, I was asked again for passphrase.  

# Solution

To resolve this issue, add [this script](http://askubuntu.com/a/634573/64325) to the `.bashrc` file.  
```bash
SSH_ENV=$HOME/.ssh/environment

# start the ssh-agent
function start_agent {
    echo "Initializing new SSH agent..."
    # spawn ssh-agent
    /usr/bin/ssh-agent | sed 's/^echo/#echo/' > "${SSH_ENV}"
    echo succeeded
    chmod 600 "${SSH_ENV}"
    . "${SSH_ENV}" > /dev/null
    /usr/bin/ssh-add
}

if [ -f "${SSH_ENV}" ]; then
     . "${SSH_ENV}" > /dev/null
     ps -ef | grep ${SSH_AGENT_PID} | grep ssh-agent$ > /dev/null || {
        start_agent;
    }
else
    start_agent;
fi
```
When Cmder starts Bash after the script is added, it'll run the script for the first time. You'll get asked to provide the passphrase for the key, then it should be saved from then on.
