# Problem

Adobe Creative Cloud creates a folder under the user profile. It's not clear what this folder is for, how do I remove it?

# Solution

This is the sync folder for Creative Cloud. 
You can use Creative Cloud > Preferences > Creative Cloud > Files
You can turn off sync, and delete the folder
Or, you can move the folder somewhere else
