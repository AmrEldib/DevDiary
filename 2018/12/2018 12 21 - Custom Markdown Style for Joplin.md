# Problem

Default style for rendering markdown in Joplin isn't great

# Solution

- Joplin allows for creating custom userstyle by placing a file at `~/.config/joplin-desktop/userstyle.css` 
- There are a number of already-built markdown styles avaliable at [markdown-styles](https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles)
