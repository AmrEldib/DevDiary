# Notepad++ Plugins

[Notepad++ x64](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7-released.html) doesn't support all plugins, only those that are complied for x64.  
To install x86 version using Chocolatey: `choco install notepadplusplus.install --x86`

## Two ways to install Notepad++ plugins:
1. Use Plugin Manager. However, it's currently removed from Notepad++ to sort out an issue with ads that are included in the Plugin Manager. 
2. Download the plugin DLL file and paste it into `C:\Program Files(x86)\Notepad++\plugins`

## Install Plugin Manager
- If [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager) is missing, you can [install it](https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager#installation).
