How to turn on smooth scrolling for mouse and keyboard?

# Solution

- Check mouse settings to turn on smooth scrolling. Logitech has such setting.
- In Firefox, turn on _Smooth scrolling_ in Options.
- In _about:config_, change _toolkit.scrollbox.verticalScrollDistance_ to 10 instead of 3 to increase the number of lines each keyboard arrow press would scroll. [Source](https://superuser.com/a/568386/96992)
- In Windows settings, change _Choose how many lines to scroll each time_ to 10. In Windows 10 start menu, search to find this setting.
